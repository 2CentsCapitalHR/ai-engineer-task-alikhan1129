# ADGM Corporate Agent â€” Streamlit Demo (with Google Gemini integration)

This demo app accepts `.docx` uploads, classifies document types (AoA, MoA, UBO, Register, etc.), verifies a Company Incorporation checklist, runs red-flag checks, uses a local RAG pipeline with Chroma + Sentence-Transformers, and calls Google Gemini for ADGM-specific legal compliance analysis.
